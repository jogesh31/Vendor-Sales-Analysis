Distributor Sales Analytics (Power BI Dashboard)

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing distributor-level sales performance for Aspen Surgical over the previous 12 months. The main objective was to help the Stakeholder understand extended cost trends, distributor contribution, geographic performance, and top items/customers for strategic decision-making.

The analysis was performed using Power BI, leveraging advanced data modeling, DAX measures, conditional formatting, and interactive visualizations.


🎯 Stakeholder Requirement

The Stakeholder wanted a comprehensive dashboard that could:

Analyze sales performance by distributors under different vendor codes.

Track top-selling items based on extended cost.

Identify high-value customers (end users) by facility, state, and city.

Understand geographic performance across the U.S.

Compare monthly invoice trends, seasonality, and sales spikes.

Allow users to drill down using slicers (invoice date, vendor code, distributor, and item code).


🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Power BI Desktop
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
Power Query for ETL
SQL Server


1. Traced Cost of Goods by Distributor

A ranked bar chart showing major distributors ordered by extended cost.
This helps the Stakeholder identify top-performing distributors, such as those contributing above $1M.

2. Top Items by Extended Cost

Shows the highest revenue-generating products (item codes like A1250S, ESREC, XLD-SC).
Helps in inventory planning and product demand forecasting.

3. Extended Cost Trend (Last 12 Months)

A line chart visualizing month-over-month extended cost.
Highlights:
Seasonality
Sales dips/spikes
Monthly performance variance

4. Top Customers (End Users)

By Facility Name
By State
By City

Provides clarity on which hospitals/clinics are driving the highest purchasing volume.

A filled map showing state-wise extended cost, enabling regional performance insights.
State-level table further breaks down extended cost with conditional formatting highlighting hotspots like:
NY
FL
CA
TX

6. Invoice Day Analysis

A daily-level chart showing spikes in extended cost by invoice day, useful for:
Billing cycle understanding
Operational planning

7. Dynamic Slicers for Custom Analysis

The dashboard includes:

Vendor Code
